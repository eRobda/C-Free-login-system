# C#-Free-login-system
This is very basic console app with login system. For databse use any kind of pastebin which can display raw data. Like this one: https://pastebin.com/raw/XjDnJw3Z
Don't forget to set expiration date to never and I recomend to not user pastebin.com, becase when you try to acces this website many times it blocks your ip. For test and block bypass you can use https://www.pastebin.cz/en/. It cant hold the data longer than 1 month tho.

I STRONGLY RECOMEND TO USE EDITABLE PASTE BIN!

if you have webhosting you can just create txt file, upload it to the server data and then acces it from code like this: "yourDomain.com/theTxtFile.txt"
